  "This recipe shows how JS React components can be used inside
  of UIx components and vice versa.

  In order to use JS component in UIx component there's a special
  Hiccup syntax `[:> component props & children]` where `props` is a map
  which will be transformed into JS Object with top-level keys camel-cased.
  Note that values are not touched, thus it's up to you to convert them
  before passing into JS component.

  UIx components can be adapted to JS React components
  using `uix.core.alpha/as-react`. It takes a function that takes
  JS props object transformed into immutable map.
  Again, values are not transformed."
